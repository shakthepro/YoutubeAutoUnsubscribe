 I am not responsible if this does not work for you. 
 There is a 85% success rate as  the subscribe button moves because some channels do not have a channel banner or the description is not there. This makes the button move as some elements are either too long or not in the right place.
 I hope this program works for you. Its simple and gets the job done.
